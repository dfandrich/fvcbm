Fvcbm ver. 3.0 displays Commodore 64/128
archive, self-dissolving archive and disk
image directories. This can be especially
useful in combination with a Commodore 64
emulator.  Supported archive formats are
ARC230 (ARC), self-extracting ARC230 (SDA),
Lynx, CS-DOS (LZH), self-extracting CS-DOS
(SFX), PC64 emulator files (R/S/U/P00), LBR,
64Net files (N64), emulator tape images
(T64) and disk images (D64 and X64).
