This is the source code to fvcbm, a program which displays directories of
Commodore 64 & 128 compatible archive files.

fvcbm supports the following archive types: ARC230 (not to be confused with SEA
ARC), self-extracting ARC230 (SDA), Lynx, CS-DOS (LZH), self-extracting CS-DOS
(SFX), LBR (not to be confused with LBR for CP/M), 64Net files (N64), PC64 emulator
files (R/S/U/P00), emulator tape images (T64) and emulator disk images (D64 and X64
and variants), including 1541, 1571, 1581, 8050 and 8250 disk types.

To compile it under UNIX, type:
	make
to see the supported machines, then
	make <machine>
where <machine> is one of the supported machine types.

To compile under DOS using Turbo C, type:
	make -fmakefile.dos
