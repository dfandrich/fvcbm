This archive contains the C source code to fvcbm ver. 2.1, a program which
displays directories of Commodore 64 & 128 compatible archive files.

The major changes from ver. 2.0 include:

 * Added searching through a list of file extensions to find a file
 * Added Ultra-Lynx Lynx-type archive support
 * Added N64 (64Net) file support
 * Added 1581 disk support in D64 archive type
 * Added even dumber check for D64 archive type to catch them more often
 * Added display of extra 1581 & C65 disk file types
 * Made LONG signed to fix LHA 0-length files
 * Fixed T64 archive to use correct value for number of entries
 * Added detection in T64 archive for disk file types (contrary to T64
   specs) due to somebody's broken T64 archiver (grrrr...)
 * Added placeholder for X64 disk name
 * Check for more 1541-like .x64 disk types in newer .x64 archives
 * Big-endian machine portability modifications (untested)
