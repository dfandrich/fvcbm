.SH NAME
fvcbm \- list directories of Commodore 64/128 compatible archive files

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fvcbm
displays the directories of Commodore 64 and 128 archive and self-dissolving
archive files. It can be used to determine what is contained in an archive 
and how much disk space it will take when uncompressed.  It is especially 
useful for previewing files on a network-connected machine used for downloading
Commodore software. 
.LP
If a given file cannot be found, the extension `.sda' is appended and another
attempt to open the file is made. If a file named `\-' is given,
.B fvcbm
will attempt to read the standard input for an archive's contents.
.LP
The default (wide) directory display contains a line for each file in the
archive. Each entry's display includes the file name, file type, 
uncompressed length in bytes, uncompressed length in Commodore 254 
byte disk blocks, compression method used, compression savings factor 
(as a percentage reduction of the uncompressed file), and checksum.
.LP
Most columns are totalled in the last line.  Values displayed are the number
of files in the archive, total number of data bytes in the archive, number of
disk blocks required to hold all the files in the archive, the archive type
and version number, overall compression savings factor (not including the 
extraction program for self-extracting files), and the number of disk blocks 
of compressed data in the archive.  For self-extracting archives, a `+' and
the number of disk blocks taken up by the extraction program are displayed 
following the number of blocks of data.  Adding the numbers
before and after the plus should equal the size of the archive file on disk
(because of padding and rounding, the actual size on disk may be slightly
different).
.LP
The
.B \-d
option selects a style of directory output which is similar to that produced
by Commodore disk drives. Only the file name, size in blocks and
type are displayed for each entry in the archive. The summary line totals
the number of blocks used by the entries.
.LP
.B
fvcbm
supports the following archive types: ARC230 (ARC), self-extracting ARC230 
(SDA), Lynx, CS-DOS (LZH), self-extracting CS-DOS (SFX), Commodore 64 emulator
tape images (T64), and emulator disk images (D64 and X64).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print a help message.
.TP
.B \-d
Display directory in Commodore disk directory format.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.B fvcbm
returns the following exit status:
.TP
.B 0
if no errors were encountered
.TP
.B 1
if
.B fvcbm
displayed the help message and exited
.TP
.B 2
if a file could not be found, or a read error occurred
.TP
.B 3
if the file type was not supported
.LP
If more than one filename caused an error, the status will reflect the
last error encountered.
.SH AUTHOR
Daniel Fandrich <dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca>
.LP
.B fvcbm
was inspired by Vernon D. Buerg's program 
.I fv
for
displaying directories of MS-DOS archives.
.SH BUGS
Reading an archive from the standard input does not work for some archive
types in some environments.
More suffixes should be attempted before a file is deemed not found.
Archive volume labels and `locked' file status for D64 and X64 archive types
are not displayed.
Newer versions of some archivers may create files which are not recognized by
.BR fvcbm .
Only a handful of some kinds of archive files have been tested.
.LP
Older versions of Lynx (at least versions IX
and below) do not explicitly store the length of the final file in the
archive.  This final file can therefore be improperly lengthened if it is
transferred using a file transfer protocol like XMODEM which adds extraneous
characters to the end of files. 
.B fvcbm
(and Lynx itself) has no way of determining if this has happened, and will 
display the incorrect file length if this is the case.
